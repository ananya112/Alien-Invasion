FOR THE WORKSHOP, IGNORE THE ABOVE. 

IF YOU ARE MORE CURIOUS, YOU CAN ASK DURING HACKATHON OR WITH HELP QUEUE. 
I DO NOT EXPECT THAT IT WILL MAKE SENSE TO EVERYONE EASILY, BUT THIS IS GOOD 
EXPOSURE. AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP.

WE FOCUS ON THE TEXTS BELOW.

INSERT INFORMATIONS ABOUT YOURSELF. THEN, OPEN THE FILE INDEX.HTML

<h1>My First Website</h1>
<h2>What's This</h2>
<p>
	I am learning how to make websites through <a href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org/">BluePrint</a>, and I think it's cool! I can <span class="highlight">highlight</span> random things, or add styling to specific <span id="unique-text">texts by their ids!</span>
</p>
<p>
	By the way, this link to <a href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org/" target="_blank">BluePrint</a> will open a new page, but the previous one will not. SAD.

<h2>About Me</h2>
